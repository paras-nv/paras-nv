ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!
Working on GPU performance analysis, benchmarking, and system-level optimizations. Mostly focused on OpenCL, CUDA, and ML workloads, with experience in debugging and profiling compute applications.

ðŸ”¹ Interested in low-level debugging, performance tuning, and benchmarking
ðŸ”¹ Work with NVIDIA GPUs, OpenCL, CUDA, and ML frameworks
ðŸ”¹ Use Python (pandas, NumPy), C++, and Docker in daily work

Always looking for ways to improve efficiency and optimize compute workloads.
